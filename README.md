# Predicting-Spotify-Hits
This project is designed to predict whether a song will become a "hit" based on various features such as song attributes, genre, and historical data from Spotify. Using machine learning techniques, the model aims to classify songs into "hit" or "non-hit" categories, providing valuable insights into music trends and hit potential.

Problem Overview
Predicting the success of a song before its release has always been a challenge in the music industry. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using historical data and features such as tempo, genre, and song length to determine the likelihood of a song's popularity.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for implementing machine learning models.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library for handling datasets.
NumPy: Library used for numerical calculations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for creating and evaluating predictive models.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization libraries for data analysis and model performance metrics.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment to explore data and build models.
Features
Song Attributes: Information such as tempo, key, danceability, loudness, and genre.
Predictive Model: The core of the project uses machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines) to predict whether a song is likely to become a hit.
Accuracy: The model was fine-tuned to achieve an accuracy of 90% on validation data.
How to Use the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/spotify-hits-predictor.git
cd spotify-hits-predictor
Install dependencies: Make sure to have Python 3.6+ installed. You can install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the dataset: Download the Spotify songs dataset (CSV or JSON) and place it in the data/ folder. The dataset should include columns like 'tempo', 'danceability', 'genre', and 'song_success' (binary target variable indicating 'hit' or 'non-hit').

Run the analysis: Open the Jupyter notebook spotify_hits_predictor.ipynb to explore the data and run the machine learning model:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook spotify_hits_predictor.ipynb
Make Predictions: The model will take song attributes as input, and you can call predict() to predict the outcome (hit or non-hit).

Example Usage
Here is an example of how you can make a prediction:

python
Copy code
# Example code to make a prediction
song_features = {'tempo': 125, 'danceability': 0.8, 'loudness': -5, 'genre': 'Pop'}
predict(song_features)
Output
Prediction: 'Hit' or 'Non-hit'
Future Improvements
Feature Engineering: Adding more features such as artist popularity, historical streaming data, and sentiment analysis from lyrics could improve accuracy.
Model Performance: Experimenting with ensemble methods like boosting (XGBoost) and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
Visualization: Implementing a user-friendly dashboard to visualize predictions and trends over time.
